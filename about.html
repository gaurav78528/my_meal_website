        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
          A decade ago, we set out to bring cooks together from all over to
          exchange recipes and to support each other in the kitchen. We wanted
          to create a buzzing place for others who do what we do all day long:
          talk about food! Since we started Food52 (we cook 52 weeks a year, get
          it?), tens of millions of cooks and eaters have found their way to the
          site.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Food52 you can find thousands of recipes submitted by our community
          and cooked by our editors in our very own test kitchens. Our recipes
          and articles are James Beard Award winning, our cookbooks are New York
          Times bestsellers, our Instagram is loved and followed by millions,
          and our community has grown to over 13 million people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013 we launched our shop to bring like-minded makers and artisans
          together with all of us. Today we curate the great things that allow
          you to cook and eat thoughtfully, and we’ve grown to include the home
          goods and crafts that support joyful living—and we’ve even started
          making some of these products with you! Great food isn't just about
          ingredients, it's about everything that makes a meal—it's the platter
          you serve tacos on; the composter in your kitchen; the knife you take
          on picnics. And joyful living goes beyond just the kitchen; it’s the
          beeswax candles on your table, the wreath on your doorway, the linen
          throw that accents your couch.
        </p>
        <p>
          We envision Food52 as the one place you can see thousands of test
          kitchen-approved recipes, shop the kitchenware you need to make them,
          and discuss the results with like-minded people. That same destination
          can be the go to when you need a birthday gift for a food-obsessed
          friend. The place to look for great table linens. The place to
          window-shop and daydream. We depend on—and we look forward to—your
          ideas, feedback, and support. So get ready for some inspiration and
          come hang out!
        </p>
        <p>We look forward to cooking with you!</p>
        <p>—Amanda & Merrill</p>
